# Trotter-Suzuki decompostion schemes data

In this directory, we collect the scheme data from our minimization attempts.
The schemes are first structured by their order and then the number of cycles they require.

Each folder firstly includes the raw data file `scheme_q#.out`, which was generated by the Symbolic Scheme routine of the program found in [Trotter-Suzuki_schemes](/Code/Trotter-Suzuki_schemes/) at long double precision (18 significant digits).
The scheme parameters inside this file were minimized twice, once to find the minimum region and again to pinpoint the exact values to numerical precision.
An important note here is that these scheme parameters are multiplied by 1/2 to those found in Section 2.2 of the paper "Efficient Trotter-Suzuki Schemes for Long-Time Quantum Dynamics" (see Eq. (10)).

Secondly, these scheme parameters and their errors/efficiencies were then transformed into Numpy arrays in order to be analyzed with Python.
Additionally to the scheme parameters in the notation of our implementation, we transform them into a "standard" notation, which is the one used by Omelyan et al. (see Eq. (8)).
We also transform these into the general notation with the c and d scheme parameters as defined by Eq. (9).

Finally, we collect all of these arrays in an HDF5 format in case they need to be read differently. However, loss of precision is possible due to HDF5 not supporting long_double/float128 in all formats.
